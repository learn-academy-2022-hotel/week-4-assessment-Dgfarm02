# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming? 

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is like Ruby, everything revolves around objects which makes it more human friendly in terms of reading and understanding it.  Functional programming is focused on functions. Javascript is functional programming. 

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that operates on that data. Objects are used to model real-world entities and the interactions between them. This can make it easier to design and understand complex systems.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "functions", which are mathematical constructs that take some input(s), perform a computation on them, and return an output. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and assigned to variables. This can make it easier to reason about the behavior of a program and to write code that is more concise and easier to maintain.

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Float and Interger are two different data types in Ruby. Intergers are always whole numbers, whereas float are fractional numbers.

Researched answer: An integer is a whole number, or a number without a decimal point that can be positive, negative, or zero. Integers can be of any size (subject to the limitations of the computer's memory).

A float, on the other hand, is a number that has a decimal point and can represent fractional values. Floats are stored in a format that approximates their real value, so there may be some loss of precision when storing and manipulating floats.

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return means you don't have to have to include a 'return', the code will automatically return something.

Researched answer: Implicit return" refers to the fact that the value of the last executed expression in a method is automatically returned as the result of the method, unless an explicit return statement is used.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Umm i can't remember this one, I think it has something to do with when you use 'do' and 'end'. it's a bigger bunch of code than what we were doing at the beginning of ruby...i can't remember.

Researched answer: A block is a piece of code that can be passed as an argument to a method and is executed within the context of that method. Blocks are typically used to specify additional behavior or to perform some operation on a set of data.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: We learned a couple ways just today, you can use Getters and Setters method, or the easier attr_accessor method. 

Researched answer: Oh, I was a bit off..it's a lot more simple than that. To extract a value from a hash, you can use the square bracket notation ([]) and pass in the key for the value you want to retrieve.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: I'm guessing this is a way to pass information from one class to another?

2. RSpec: Required Specifications? No idea.

3. CRUD: Create Read Update Destroy!(Delete)

4. Test-driven development: This is what we do with jest! You create tests and then create the functionality to make your tests work correctly

5. HTTP: Hypertext T Protocol I know we went over this one today but I can't remember. I know it has something to do with how websites are communicated across the internet...or how the data is transferred? 

Are we supposed to be looking these up? or is this just what we know about these topics as of right now?
